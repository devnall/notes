# notes.git

A place to stash random text that I've been compiling

## Current Contents:

* QuoteFile - A collection of quotes that I've liked
* BonMots - Random puns/jokes/wordplay/neologisms

## To Add:

* Vocab - Move my collection of weird/cool words out of BonMots into its own doc
* Cheatsheets - Move my zsh/tmux/vim/etc cheatsheets out of my dotfiles repo and into this one?
